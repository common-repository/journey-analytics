Track your customer journeys by intent and by business goal. Identify your most lucrative paths and those where customers are dropping off.

== Description ==

Track your customer journeys by intent and by business goal. Identify your most lucrative paths and those where customers are dropping off.

KONTXTâ„¢ Journey Analytics for WordPress and WooCommerce sites uses advanced machine learning and heuristics to show the best and worst performing paths your customers take across your site. These analytics will show where your traffic is coming from (off-site referrers & campaigns), where your users go while on your site and where they end up.

* Customer journey flow and waypoint analysis over time
* Filter journeys by customer intent derived by KONTXT machine learning
* Journey funnel analysis
* Journey point analysis
* Journey tracking points include: campaigns, referrers, pages, products, articles, comments, product reviews, site registrations, cart adds, orders submitted, searches, failed searches, abandoned carts and session departures.
* Supports events from WordPress core and major plugins including: WooCommerce, bbPress, WPForms, Contact Form 7, and Gravity Forms. Contact us if a plugin you use isn't listed.
